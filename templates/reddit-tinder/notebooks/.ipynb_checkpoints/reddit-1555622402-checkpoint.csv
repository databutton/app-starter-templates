7,Industrial Designer looking into data science..,"Hello everyone! Im an industrial designer, who has been really struggling to find a stable job due to my industry being flooded with designers. I have scratched and clawed for over a year, and finally now found a position but I hardly deal with designing, and its more of product quality control and dealing with manufacturing issues... 

&amp;#x200B;

As much as I love what I went to school for, and what i'm good at, I think staying in this field will be more trouble than its worth. Unfortunately, I do not see a future for myself here anymore, and I feel like I wasted a lot of time trying to make it work..

I'm also a veteran, and recently have been given a chance to take some classes; That's where I ran into Data Science. My local community college offers a 4-5 class course they say is enough to start me in the DS field, or at least to get me to a point where I can find an internship and job. I find coding very interesting, and starting to research into AI (also very interesting to me).

11,I'm (30 M) thinking about switching from psychology into data science. Do you guys think it's doable?,"Hello friends. 

Some info about my background: My first degree in in Psychology. Then I decided to do a generic MSc in Psychology again and it's when I came in touch with some basic research methodology. I learnt spss and a bit of R from the scratch and gained some experience on data analysis ( used regression, lots of Factor Analysis, some multilevel modeling on some quantitative projects).


 I was keen quantitative analysis on research but didn't engage a lot after my masters cause I got a full time job in a hospital. Two years after, I have arrived to the realization that psychology is not for me and I cannot imagine myself on this field anymore. Having this in mind and considering the fact that I liked statistical analysis, I decided to apply for a MSc in data science and analytics of Cardiff University.


 Surprisingly, I was accepted even though the requirement was first degree on a numerical subject. To be honest I am very excited by this upcoming challenge but at the same time I'm also worried that I won't be able to pull it off. I have no idea about programming, coding and whatsoever and the particular course is full of python, machine learning etc.


Do you think that shifting from a theoretical field like psychology towards data science and programming is doable on my 30s? Is prior knowledge of Algebra, calculus necessary?",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/bexm67/im_30_m_thinking_about_switching_from_psychology/,3,6,1555669759

18,"Why arguing about who is a ""Real Data Scientist"" is a misguided exercise","One of the most common arguments these days revolves around what constitutes a ""real"" Data Scientist, and by proxy, who is deserving of the Data Scientist title. A popular opinion is that Data Scientists need to do machine learning or they're not real data scientists.

I think this completely misses the point of job titles: job titles are not meant to define a role. Job titles are meant to be corporate abbreviations for job descriptions. It is job descriptions that are matched against outside salary references, and it is job descriptions that are graded for pay purposes. Job descriptions are used for hiring purposes and ultimately job descriptions describe the job that you do.

There are some professions where titles have very real meanings (Lawyers who pass the bar exam, Professional Engineers who pass the P.E. exam, Accountants who are certified CPAs, etc.), but the majority of titles don't mean anything, and Data Scientist is certainly in that camp.

Other examples:

- At a lot of large corporation, you see Sr. Managers that don't manage anyone (i.e., have no direct reports).

- Every person in national/executive sales is a VP, even though they are not responsible for a P&amp;L and often don't even have direct reports. Oh, and they make less money than a Director in every other branch of the company.

- Every bank title is incredibly inflated (again, TONS of VPs)

- Every quant/trading title is incredibly deflated - they'll seemingly call someone an analyst their whole lives even if they're making 400k and have 15 years experience.

The only constraints on job titles are often internal, and a consequence of how they fit relative to existing internal job descriptions. Specifically, if a specific job title term (e.g., Engineer, Analyst, Consultant) has traditionally been associated with a certain set of skills and responsibilities, a new role that has completely new requirements should in general avoid using the same title.

So why are so many companies giving Data Science titles to people who don't do Machine Learning given that the original data scientists had to? Here is what the life-cycle of creating a role looks like *at a company that doesn't have existing data science capabilities*:

1) Hiring manager decides she needs a new person with a profile that doesn't exist in the form of an existing job description. She needs this person to do mostly analysis, but she also needs them to be able to write code in Python to automate some processes, build the occasional model (likely not a production model), and access back-end databases directly and often. She may also, in time, need this person to dedicate more time to building more advanced statistical models, maybe even ML models, but as of right now that is highly uncertain because the company has never used ML in the past.

2) After writing this job description, the key hitting points look something like this: 

* Must have 2+ years experience with R/Python
* Must have 2+ years experience with SQL
* Must have experience building statistical models.
* A whole bunch of business and soft skills stuff

3) HR receives this job description and they now need to grade it. Since they have Analyst/Sr Analyst roles already, they compare the job description against those roles. They quickly find that none of those job descriptions require R/Python, SQL or building models. But they do match a lot of the other requirements, so it becomes clear that they will need a different type of role that is both different (includes Python/SQL/Modeling) and higher (more requirements) than the existing Analyst/Sr. Analyst roles. They may have even higher levels of Analyst (Lead, Principal), but none of them will require the use of Python/SQL/Modeling, so the fact of the matter is that they are going to need to get away from the Analyst title or otherwise create confusion and internal inconsistencies.

4) In order to do their benchmarking, HR pulls salaries and comp from an external data source that helps them match job description requirements to those posted by other companies. They work their way through putting the job description requirements into the system, and the system tells HR what jobs with similar JDs pay, including a range. It also tells this person the titles of the people who have similar JDs - which will likely include jobs that are legitimate Data Science jobs as they require R, Python, SQL, and statistical modeling experience. But it also will include some Analyst roles that do require programming skills (maybe some quant roles), and other random role titles that no one would think of looking into. All in all, the job grade that comes back is higher than an Analyst role (because of the added skills), but not quite as high as that of the first-gen Data Scientists, i.e., Ph.D. + 5 years experience in Silicon Valley. 

5) Now they need a job title. They know they can't name the role ""Analyst"" or ""Sr. Analyst"" because the skill set (and job grading) is different. Therefore they want to avoid having one ""Analyst"" making considerably more money than the rest of the Analysts, and also would like to make it clear that current Analysts may not have the skillset needed for this new role. They may, but it cannot be assumed by default that they do. They currently don't have any data scientists, so there's no toes to step on there, so it becomes a natural solution to name this new role ""Data Scientist"". Why that and not a completely new title to avoid clashing with the existing Data Scientist roles that are more senior in the marketplace?

* **You want a title that can be easily found by people with the right skillset**: because the candidate you are looking for has some characteristics of an old school data scientist and some of an analyst, you want to hit with a title that will catch the high-end of the pool you're looking for. ""Analyst"" may leave some of those people out. 

* **You want the role to be easy to find**: you can title the job ""Programming Friendly Analyst"", but it would just make it harder to get it to show up on searches. Meanwhile, because people are searching for the Data Scientist role often, it gives you better visibility. 

And there you have it, you now have a Data Scientist opening that you can post. Odds are you will get a wide range of candidates applying, including some who will be greatly overqualified (but will inquire because of the Data Science title being so variable), but you will end up hiring someone who is, ideally, at the top end of your requirements.

More importantly, as more and more companies do this, the general convergence is not based on original data science roles, but rather the new data science roles that are going to be more common because they will fill a need in a much larger market (i.e., more companies need people to tame their data and run basic modeling, fewer companies are ready for cutting edge ML).

You will certainly have organizations where step 5 is different, i.e., where the ""Analyst"" roles already have programming requirements (quants, consulting are all great examples), and in that case it makes sense that Data Scientist will be defined as ""can do ML"", because the only reason to create a new role will be to differentiate people who can do analysis, modeling, and programming from those who can do all of those things AND build machine learning models.

And then you have the even more extreme examples, FANGs, where you are seeing the creation of roles that are even more technical than Data Scientist (like Applied Scientist and Research Scientist and ML Engineer), which - again - were likely required to create internal differentiation between people who can execute machine learning models vs. people who can develop brand new machine learning concepts/scale machine learning to solve massively complex applications/etc.

On to my last point: to those who are on the cutting edge of machine learning and AI knowledge who feel ""icky"" getting lumped in with us simpletons who are just running fancy regression models to make our companies more money - just know that the reason your salaries are continuing to increase is because the number of companies hiring Data people like myself to solve simpleton problems is blowing up the market, and creating a scarcity everywhere in the field that is driving salaries up. So, while I understand that you like the prestige of having a title that reflects just how much more about machine learning you know that the rest of us, please appreciate that the popularity of the general field of Decision Science has greatly benefited you directly.

**TL;DR: No one company/group of people get to dictate what is/isn't a ""Data Scientist"". It is a natural response of the market to allow those companies looking for employees to find the right job seekers while satisfying internal corporate constraints. To continue to argue about who is/isn't a data scientist is pointless, because the title itself actually doesn't mean anything. Most importantly, a rising tide lifts all boats, and we have all benefited from the demand for all types of data scientists.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/bezjso/why_arguing_about_who_is_a_real_data_scientist_is/,81,304,1555683113

23,"A data science bootcamp won’t replace a cs or math degree. However, it is an excellent supplement to your credentials should you have a cs/math degree.","I did a data science bootcamp and a cs degrees some time ago. Most of my cohort still is unemployed. Why? Many didn’t do quantitative degrees prior to the bootcamp. The ones who did land jobs happened to have a technical background prior to the bootcamp. 

So people ask why even do a data science bootcamp in the first place? 

(1) bootcamps will train you to create a portfolio of data science projects that you can show your future employers. You can create the basic Ames housing competition but you will also do nlp for Reddit posts, time series for the West Nile virus Kaggle data set, and a capstone of your choice. Could university do this? Sure but many don’t. 

(2) you will greatly improve certain aspects of your data science background considerably. This mostly will be your python/sql abilities. Yes school teaches you python and sql but if all you have is a semester or two, chances are you probably will forget. A data science bootcamp will make you code in python for several hours and home some of these skills. Bootcamps are 8 hours a day and five days a week. This helps greatly for the technical interviews at most companies. 

(3) boot camps will make you realize that your fellow student is a great teacher. A lot of data science isn’t just clean, apply logistic regression, get 99% accuracy and you’re done. It’s also understanding how to approach different data science problems. When you see 15 presentations on how to accurately predict housing prices in Iowa, you learn a lot about how to approach this problem in multiple angles. This will make you a better thinker and speaker. 

(4) connections- if you do a bootcamp in San Francisco, I’m not gonna lie...it’s not cheap...but a lot of the bootcamps career coaches are connected with employers and can hook you up. That’s appealing especially in a competitive market like San Francisco. 

Downsides
Many data science bootcamps struggle to find teachers who are experts in the field. Why? Industry scoops them up with much higher salaries. You may end up learning from an unemployed former bootcamp grad. That might mean you won’t get a full understanding of all the concepts especially more advanced concepts such as markov chains. 

Many employers won’t look at your resume if you don’t have a cs or math or stats degree. There’s already so many that do so why consider yours. Also how does a 12 week program replace what four years of college can teach? Some claim it can but it’s met with a lot of skepticism.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/bf0lib/a_data_science_bootcamp_wont_replace_a_cs_or_math/,15,10,1555688649

This is free and automated but a lot of hassle to maintain and frankly I'm one of the few guys who understands the codebase. I'd rather use some tooling if I can so new functionality is added and thoroughly tested instead of custom made by me. 

  
Solutions I'm considering: 

\- Power BI paginated report builder (we use PBI for data viz / dashboard building). This has the advantage that it's point and click but the disadvantage that you're locked into PBI and don't need the extra functionality when all I want to share is a list of data.

34,Data science/BI in Financial institutions/Asset Management?,"Hello,  


I have a question. I am finishing my BSc in business, which is followed by a specialization MSc of chosen area. I was choosing between Finance and BI/Data Science/analytics. It was a very hard decision, because i enjoyed finance a bit more, but was told the other options is super high in demand. On top of that I thought as long as I am interested in Finance i will also learn finance more and more anyway, whereas if i choose Finance, i won't learn much of data science on my own.

I was planning to do CFA for myself, as AM is probably the reason why i loved finance, I am obsessed about figuring out optimal portfolio based on what specific untradeable assets i own and so on.

Therefore I came to a conclusion - is BI/Data science combinable with CFA? It is a weird combo/rare combo/maybe good combo, but also risky combo, because AM+Data science is such a specific area.

EDIT: I know that term-dropping of DS is not really appropiate in my case, but you understand what i mean - my Masters includes stuff like : SQL/R/Python/Applied Data science/BI/Machine learning/Bayesian networks, i have taken extra courses of data science in uni and so on.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/bf5yge/data_sciencebi_in_financial_institutionsasset/,5,1,1555717336

54,Can hetero-scedasticity ever be a good thing?,"I am working on a multiple linear regression model for estimating customer incomes, as part of an affordability assessment for lending, and I expect that I will have some hetero-scedasticity in some form or another. Specifically I expect that the residuals will be much smaller for lower income customers than for higher income customers.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that it would usually be best practice to apply some sort of non-linear transformation to my dependent variable to correct for this, but I'm wondering if this is necessarily the right thing to do because of the context in which this model will be used.

&amp;#x200B;

Higher income customers are likely to pass the affordability assessment regardless, and an estimate of their salary that is out by 20% is much less likely to affect the decision of whether to lend to them. In contrast a customer with low income is more likely to be on the margin in terms of whether they should receive lending, and an estimate that is out by 20% will have a big influence on the decision, which will have some potentially serious consequences for the lender and the customer.

&amp;#x200B;

So what are my options in this scenario?

&amp;#x200B;

My first thought is leave it as it is, don't try to correct for hetero-scedasticity, with the justification that it is desirable in this context. Added to this is the fact that interpretability is very important to stakeholders, and if I were to say, predict log(income) instead of income, some would be uncomfortable with a model that isn't linear- they would want to be able to follow the calculation easily, with interpretable coefficients etc.. A downside I can imagine is that the confidence intervals would be a bit meaningless, but these wouldn't really be taken into account operationally anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

Another thought I had would be to use a non-linear transformation like log to make it more homo-scedastic, and weight the lower income data points to make sure the model performs better on the marginal customers. I don't know if this is common practice though, so a I'm a bit wary of this approach.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd be really interested to hear some thoughts on this.

67,"For Naive Bayes, is it necessary to limit the number of values for attribute if data set is small?","I got a bunch of images of solder joints on a PCB that are manually labeled, the goal is to recognize a good joint vs bad joint. There are shadows that are different color than the actual solder. The metal contacts are also a different color.

But even the same part can have a different RGB value from one image to the next due to variances in ambient light, etc.

I would think for Naive Bayes, I should segment the colors first right? Because the 'same' color to the human eye can appear as many different RGB colors and Naive Bayes would treat them as different which would lead do poor performance given the limited number of training images. I plan to only focus on 4 colors - the shadow, the solder, the reflective sheen of solder, and the metal joint, and segment it in a way that each ""area"" would have a single RBG value.

Furthermore, the corresponding areas across different images should have the same RGB value. So essentially, I'm limiting the number of values for each pixel attributes, which should prevent overfitting.

Is this necessary to do or am I overthinking it?

71,Advice required for stumped Reporting / Data Analyst,"  

Hi everyone, I would like to get some insights regarding my current job situation.

 

**Premise:**

* Been at current job for 5 years (promoted twice)
* Started out as a Reporting Analyst 
* Scope expanded through the years, involvement with projects, management reporting 

 

**Considerations:**

* Predominantly working with Microsoft Excel, organization has recently introduced newer analytical / visualization software
* Very stressful hours, averaging 12 to 14 hour days, mostly due to too many overlapping deadlines and outdated processes
* High turn over rate and difficulty in locating replacements
* My direct manager is leaving the team, leaving myself, a new hire (less than 3 months), 2 contract staff

 

The majority of my day to day work involves Excel reporting and some data analysis; over the years we have attempted to optimize processes through VBA macros, building and maintenance of localized database for data retrieval. The reporting work is relatively mundane, we have pre-saved SQL queries and excel templates and users just have to perform some manipulations to the raw data.

  

We have been in survival mode for the last 2 years, struggling to get up to speed with the day to day reporting requirements. (2 team members left). The work is tedious due to the sheer amount of reports required. We have reached out to management to review the decommissioning of reports that are no longer required, but the business teams have consistently raised their objections.

While this was going on, I  have completed classes to improve my foundation in data analytics (statistics, predictive modeling, text and data mining foundations, hands on usage of data analytics software).  As it stands, I am continuing to self learn Python and Tableau. 

  

On the other front, the organization is advancing slowly, introducing more analytical and visualization tools for usage. The main challenge I face now is that I barely have the time to fulfill our daily reporting requirements. The only way I get to devote any attention to implementing process enhancements / using these new tools is to come back to work on the weekends. The current process enhancements on my roadmap:

 

* Using Tableau to retire our older Excel dashboards
* Using Python scripts to automate existing Excel reports
* Conceptualization and building of our division's data warehouse to be synced with the rest of the organization

  

I recognize that I need to improve my skillsets in order to advance further into data analytics, but my current workload is making it really challenging. With the departure of my direct manager,  I find myself having to stand in for his position and am loaded with additional managerial responsibilities. Judging from the past track record, it would take more than a year to find his replacement.  
 

It feels like a catch 22 situation here. I am not technically skilled enough to cross over into data analytics and starting from a entry level or junior position would most likely result in a steep pay-cut. But the longer I stay in the organization, the more burnt out I get and the lesser time I have to focus on my self development. The last thing I'd want is to be stuck in a position where I am overpaid yet only equipped with a limited repertoire of competencies.

Would love to hear some insights on how I should approach this dilemma. Thank you and sorry for the wall of text!

72,Next steps? Promotion coming my way..,"Tldr at bottom

Found this sub a while back and have loved piggy backing on a lot of the advice. But was hoping to get some discussion on where I am going in my career/in my company. Let me make this very clear before I get roasted- I am not a data scientist. I am a financial analyst and all senior management hears is ""analyst"". 

It started when I landed a job underwriting commercial debt, with it came the bitch work sincr I was the new guy... was given a lot of shitty reports to make up each week/month/quarter/year. Well I  hated those reports, so I self studied and figured out how to automate them using vba. Eventually automating most my job.. Well to better benefit the company I started walking around my department automating everything with shitty vba scripts. 

All of senior management caught a hold of this and thought I should do it for the whole company.  I realized I couldn't use vba for everything unless the whole thing was gonna implode. So I got with our IT department who had an abandoned data warehouse project. I figured out enough sql to get all of our core systems pointed at it with some help from IT setting up FTPs. And set up the reports to automate out of this warehouse. 

Well after the reports were set up, I started getting into financial modeling, and realized I could just practice on my company. Senior Management's buzzword of the month was ""OKR"" at this point, so I thought up of some undeniable OKRs and set up a little dashboard for our loan officers so they could track those and their incentives themselves. My management then demands I make this dashboards for everyone. 

Well they want to promote me and give me the title ""Senior Data Analyst"", comes with a pretty cool raise too and I am pretty much my own boss with no direct over sight. But idk how I feel about the position because I don't know what I could do next. They will also pay for me to get a masters in data science from a decent state school. 

tldr; not actually a data analyst, just automated all our reports and built some dashboards that track okrs &amp; incentives. Have a ton of career momentum right now because of it - what are some new things I can do next?

78,Masters in Data Sicence/Data analytics for me?,"I know this questions gets probably asked a lot. I'm sorry.  


But I'm trying to know what to do in my situation.  


**Here is my situation: (sorry in advance if I put too much useless information about me)**  
I'm finishing a business degree at the moment in IT. (probably called MIS in usa I think?)  
I did some CS classes but dropped out.

**More about me:** 

I feel like in business I don't really belong since I'm not excellent at communication. I'm quiet a shy person too. Also, I find people in my business degree, kind of dumb (most of them). When I was in CS,  I felt like people were actually smart (well most of them). When I think about it, maybe I dropped CS because I was too lazy but keep telling myself I dropped out because I didn't like it. I don't know.   
I'm also introvert and like logic, problem solving, video games , etc.  


**My question is:**  
Since I don't have a STEM degree should I go for a master degree in DataScience.   
Cost is around $15-20 000 for the 2year degree. The degree includes: Algorithm for optimization and Big Data analysis, Decision analysis, forecasting methods, Machine learning, machine learning 2 , dvanced statistical learning, statistical modeling etc.  
I know some people recommend to do CS instead, but since I don't have a degree in CS. Masters in CS would be near impossible. That is why I'm considering data science/data analytics degree",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/bfxs9c/masters_in_data_sicencedata_analytics_for_me/,8,4,1555906203

80,I am a graduate student that wants to do research in a different university’s lab.,"Entering in a MSCS program this fall and I want to get into research. Unfortunately the school I will be attending does not have much in the way of research opportunities. But there is a school in the same city that has high research activity in very interesting areas and I’d like to work there. 

Also, I come from a nonCS (biochemistry) undergrad but I have done lots of research as an undergrad and I am published.

It appears there are 3 things to consider:
1. No CS background
2. Student at different university (non-international so study abroad doesn’t apply)
3. A masters student (not a PhD)

Ideally I’d spend the entire 2 year program working in research but I may have a hard time convincing a PI to take me in being unproven.
Alternatively, I could wait 1 or 2 semesters and then ask for an opportunity. Although I don’t know if they would be as receptive for just a year long stint.

I’m conflicted on when I should start applying for jobs. People always says the market for data scientist is really hot so I don’t want to apply too early and have to move too soon. At the same time, I don’t want to be overly confident and end up without a job. I also know that wanting to relocate might make it more difficult as well.

89,Going wrong in scoring social media posts of a user based on the post history and influence,"So I'm a student who got an outsourced data science gig doing self-directed learning on this data-set, just imagine a data-set similar to Instagram. Where we have USER table with the userID, account creation date, number of followers, number of following, description, handle, gender, and other important profile info and table POSTS with the posts on social media with the no of likes, no of comments, reach, date, date posted, trending etc. Then I also have csv full of comments which I'm not using for the analysis now.

Now I want to create a model that will score these posts based on the popularity and performance. So my first and my very naive approach was to split the POSTS into the train and test randomly. Then on the train, I would group by the userId and create aggregate features ['sum', 'max', 'min', 'mean', 'var'] on the different numeric columns. Then I would add merge this data to the USER with its own numeric columns, I would call this table HISTORY, which would give us the past performance of the post. Then the really stupid thing I did (I think?) was to add the HISTORY data back to the train POSTS (yes, the same one which I used to aggregate features of) and test POSTS.

The scoring metric I used to score the post was sigmoid(log(like+1) + log(reach + 1) + log(no of comments + 1) + log(trending + 1)) which yielded a score between 0 and 1. But there was an excess amount of posts with score 0. So while training I had to undersample the zero scores. And I used the Post Time + History to predict this particular score.

So I'm doing self-directed learning this data-set and it's kind of an outsourced work to me and I feel like I'm stuck making progress in the wrong direction. I think I went wrong on the following places

• Creating a proper metric for scoring the posts, a better way to score posts?
• Using the train data to generate aggregate history than using the same train data to append this history onto. 
• Splitting the train and test data randomly. Because in this case, if a post on the train is a user's first post, I would add the HISTORY to this post but that doesn't make any sense in reality.
• The data is spread over 2 years, is some inconsistency going to creep up?
• Most of the scoring lies in this [distribution](https://imgur.com/JaXQBpJ), I would like it to be spread out. 
• To judge the performance of the model, I was using Precision. The number of high-quality posts, which was actually scored high. Is this a proper metric to use? Can we actually use the confusion matrix here by setting a threshold on the score to differentiate between posts that scored high and low?
• How to prepare train and test data? Should I use 70% Posts to aggregate features, then use 25% for training and 5% for testing?
 
I feel like I've approached this problem wrong from the first step itself and I did a lot of thinking to myself but I'm incapable of figuring out what's wrong. Any insights, tips and resources would literally save my life.

- ETL pipelines and best practices

- How to work with databases (especially Redshift) beyond just querying them

- Spark/Hadoop (I don't think this is as applicable to my current situation, but would be nice to have more knowledge on)

96,Engine maintenance requirements vs Usage - data sources?,"Hi all,

All engines, whether truck, car or lawn mower, become reliable with time - **but what does the shape of that curve look like?**  I  am looking for some generic motor vehcile data and hope you know where to point me. The data I seek might be referred to as:

* Engine Mileage vs Maintenance Effort, or 
* Car Mileage vs Reliability

I am specifically NOT after 'Car Mileage vs *Cost*' because, as Engers points our in their 2012 paper ""Automobile Maintenance Costs, Used Cars, and Private Information"", ""that cost declines after Year 10 may result from signicant reductions in usage of the vehicle and reduced insurance costs""

**I am specificallly looking for information** on typical levels of required maintenance to cars/engines (as interventions not $) vs distance travelled. 

This question is not specific to make or model, so generic curve shape will do.
