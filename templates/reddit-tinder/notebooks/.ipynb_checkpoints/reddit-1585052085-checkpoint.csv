6,Predict a lot of y's,"Hi guys, I am a bit new to this stuff and looking for some help on how to tackle this problem.

I have a dataset of departments, with clients (and their needs) and staff (and their hours) for each day. I am looking for a way to predict how much (in hours) of each 'type' of staff (likely based on their position in the team), given a set of expected clients and other factors. 

As far as I can tell, to predict the expected hours for every position type, requires a seperate model for every position type. My case is that there a lot of different positions, and potentially a very large amount of models to essentially create one dataset.

What is an efficient way to tackle this? Should I automate modelling for every y is there a better way to think about this problem?",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fo7sd5/predict_a_lot_of_ys/,7,1,1585066549

Now I wanna do something about it.
I know basic sql, r, tableau, excel and now working on python. 
Took 1 C course during a sem in college. 
Never had a data internship (it’s all a ripple effect) have been close to getting a job twice out of hundreds of applications, but that I know is due to my incompetence in the subject matter. 

Currently I have been trying to do some home studying to better my beginner understanding in the subject by doing the codeacademy data science course and working on a textbook called thinking in python 2e. 

Hence, I’m looking for a mentor/meetups in the city that could help guide me and teach me the foundation of learning the subject and gaining my own independence as well as learning to equip myself with the necessary knowledge and strategies on nailing job interviews within this industry.

I am interested in Data Science, as of now I have a good command of python and a portion of the PyData stack (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, studying scikit-learn). I know basic SQL, studying the necessary Statistics and math, and am planning to join Kaggle competitions and build my own personal projects over the next 2 years.

I personally have little desire to get a bachelors degree and would want to start working right after school (also partially due to financial limitations).

The country of work would for the first few years be either Malta or Russia, after which I plan to go work in Australia for 4 years to become a citizen there. There is a chance I might need to get a bachelors degree to avoid getting drafted to the Russian army.

What would your advice be for me in my current situation?

in `statsmodel` I like that you can used method *summary()* to print all the details and metrics of the regression, is there something similar for the `sklearn`?

I have also received admits from the University of Washington - Seattle for Applied and Computational Mathematics, and the University of Colorado - Boulder for Statistics and Data Science. I will be paying the full international tuition at UW - Seattle. CU Boulder has offered me a merit scholarship, but is still much more expensive than the University of Arizona. Bearing the cost of either of these universities will be very hard for me. I will most likely have to take out out a loan if I want to attend CU Boulder or UW Seattle. On the other hand, I can easily afford to attend the University of Arizona without having to take a loan. 

I am interested in working in the tech industry. Since Seattle is a major tech hub, and also has an active startup scene, would this make UW Seattle a more attractive option?

I know that there are already posts on here about Springboard, but I hope that this will provide some additional valuable insights on the program to anyone who is considering joining. Bad idea!

Why You Shouldn't Join Springboard:

1. Springboard generally does not produce data scientists in their Data  Science bootcamp
2. The job guarantee only applies if you take your first job that you receive and offer from, and if that offer **pays at least $50,000.** 
3. The CEOs [Gautam Tambay](https://twitter.com/gautambay?lang=en) and [Parul Gupta](https://twitter.com/parul8ue?lang=en) don't seem to have much visibility / signal on the Internet, compared to Lambda School's [Austin Allred](https://twitter.com/Austen?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor), who is followed by Ian Goodfellow, Jeff Dean, and Jeremy Howard on Twitter.
4. The course material has been plucked mostly from DataCamp (very basic) and a plethora of videos/articles (all of which are FREE).

&amp;#x200B;

Not conviced? Let's dive right in.

&amp;#x200B;

# 1. Springboard generally does not produce data scientists in their Data  Science bootcamp

I'll start from the beginning, where my bullshit meter picked up its first red flags.

I was first intrigued by that job guarantee. ""Hmm... so you're telling me I can become a real data scientist after this??""

[Springboard's Data Science bootcamp: claiming a job guarantee](https://preview.redd.it/py1m5ek7bzo41.png?width=771&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=297299da8ccf25d2f87296f2ba8b347ee312dfd5)

No, there are a few problems with that statement. There is no guarantee that you will become a data scientist, just that you will get a job. And after looking through the course material while on my 7-day trial, I came across a video stating that Springboard actually mostly produces data analysts/ risk analysts/analysts.

[Most Springboard alums have the role of data analyst or risk analyst, not data scientist](https://preview.redd.it/tnv3ezsdbzo41.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d1b5e8279a2aa468c97520d1cea36049dd62e36)

[Still don't believe me? Ok here you go.](https://preview.redd.it/fbttam09dzo41.png?width=1046&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=13b830e2ccc100b455c56c719a6485b635b9417f)

&amp;#x200B;

And indeed, I love using LinkedIn to cross-check people and find my facts, so I looked up all the alumni in their alumni spotlight page, and indeed found that the majority of people who graduated from Springboard's program actually had Data Analyst / Business Analyst as their first job upon graduation. You know those people who put buzzwords on their headline for no fcking reason? Yeah, I found a few of those 🤷.

Ok, so I don't get to become a data scientist. There must be something good about this program, right??

&amp;#x200B;

# 2. The job guarantee only applies if you take your first job that you receive and offer from, and if that offer pays at least $50,000. 

My BS alarm rang a second time while I was pondering the idea of salary. You see, Springboard may guarantee a job, but will this job pay the kind of salary that I'm expecting a ~~data scientist~~ data analyst to make? Well, I used *their* salary calculator that they advertise on their page, which tells me 

[if I became an entry-level data scientist, I would make $121,935 a year in SF](https://preview.redd.it/2bvzjybbczo41.png?width=1186&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=000ad9752bf7dc9b8601745b9024ad4eaa9623ac)

that the average data scientist makes $121,935 a year, which is three times I made in my last job (I'm currently unemployed ;() On the other hand, an entry-level data analyst typically makes around $70,000 in SF. So, yeah, that's some BS.

So I mentioned I like looking up people on LinkedIn, right? Well, I looked up the first face you see on Springboard's home page:

[sorry Kavisha, this isn't personal](https://preview.redd.it/sdmeqww3ezo41.png?width=645&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e4d6e96c618d273ec5bd29810d25937db0e6436)

It turns out this individual took the Springboard Data Science Bootcamp, and is now a Software Quality Operations Associate at Waymo. Sounds amazing, right??

No. It's a contractor position that pays $25 an hour. How do I know? Because I worked in a similar role in Apple's autonomous system team , and I get e-mails from staffing agencies about this position ALL THE TIME (they are very upfront about the hourly rate, and also thanks [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/software-quality-operations-associate-salary-SRCH_KO0,37.htm)).

 So technically, Kavisha made 25/hr -&gt; $50,000 a year.

Now, Springboard's claim that if you don't find a job that pays $50k+ within 6 months of graduation, you'll get a full refund of the tuition. Now, there was no guarantee that they would find you a data scientist role, and ***they never explicitly mention their graduates' average salary*** (only beating around the bush!). So that meant poor Kavisha must accept this job and live off a salary of $50k in Silicon Valley, with no refund, because she made just the right amount to not be eligible for a refund :(

 By this point, my brain was telling me SCAM, but I wanted to check something.

&amp;#x200B;

# 3. The CEOs [Gautam Tambay](https://twitter.com/gautambay?lang=en) and [Parul Gupta](https://twitter.com/parul8ue?lang=en) don't seem to have much visibility / signal on the Internet, compared to Lambda School's [Austin Allred](https://twitter.com/Austen?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor), who is followed by Ian Goodfellow, Jeff Dean, and Jeremy Howard on Twitter.

I mentioned I like looking people up on LinkedIn, right?? Well, turns out I also like looking up people on Twitter because it's now one of my primary sources of getting useful bits of information from really really smart people in data science and machine learning whom I admire and follow. Consequently, I can simply look up who's connected to whom in my network. Well, I looked up the Springboard CEOs, and guess how many of their followers do I follow? 0. None. 

On the other hand, Austin Allred, the CEO of Lambda School, another data science / software engineering bootcamp (which seems badass by the way, simply because the majority of the time spent in their online curriculum is actually doing whiteboarding in the morning, group projects in the afternoon, and coding sprints just like in an engineering team!), is followed by Ian Goodfellow, Jeff Dean, Jeremy Howard, Sam Altman, Tim Ferriss, among others in my network, which gives *way* more credibility towards this program. 

And since they were in [Y Combinator's 2017 Summer batch](https://blog.ycombinator.com/a-cs-education-thats-free-until-you-get-a-job-austen-allred-of-lambda-school/) and were funded by Y Combinator, their network is so profoundly valuable and talented that according to [this post](https://medium.com/@alimirio/why-you-should-join-lambda-school-and-forget-about-other-coding-bootcamps-c56fa9acd6a0), **Lambda School and other bootcamps is like deciding between Stanford University and Devry University.**  

I might as well look up the Springboard mentors as well! So I did, and they seem pretty legit. But still, it's not worth it, because to be completely honest, for anyone out there looking for mentors or connections to a job, all you have to do is find the right people whose work you admire, either through a friend, family member, connection, or even LinkedIn, and spark a conversation with them and ask them questions about their work. If you are genuinely excited, they would be happy to share you with you and perhaps even help refer you. Trust me, this is way more fun than meeting a ""mentor"" on Google Hangouts who is paid to speak to you and give you guidance about your upcoming Capstone Project and career.

&amp;#x200B;

# 4. The course material has been plucked mostly from DataCamp (very basic) and a plethora of videos/articles (all of which are FREE).

Ok, for the scammiest part of all! Almost none of the material they created is original content! Most of the first half of the course comprises of DataCamp courses, which you could just take without this bootcamp. The other half of the course comprises of articles and videos that they link to and tell you to look at. And then, there are a few minute long videos where a Springboard employee will introduce you to the chapter and tell you why it's important, or give you guidance on career/ interview. But that's it, folks. There's almost no originality in these courses. 

I came to a bootcamp like this mainly because I felt like I needed to improve my skills in deploying data science to production, because most of my data science background has been in academia and small projects. I needed big boy professional experience! But what I came to realize is that I could have just googled: ""deploy data science to production"" and gotten the same results as this bootcamp. Yes, Springboard is profiting off of Youtube videos and Github repositories. Shame!

In case you were wondering what those materials were, here are some useful tidbits of material I found from Springboard's course that I found to be useful (sharing this because it was meant to be shared, not sold):

&amp;#x200B;

So what did I learn, that hopefully you can take away from?

TL;DR This bootcamp is a scam. You probably won't become a data scientist. 

You'll probably get a job as a data analyst that pays around $70,000.

The credibility of the company's execs are dubious, compared to Lambda School's, by a far margin.

80,Data Scientists are just glorified analysts (and why Research Scientist is the new Data Scientist),"Data Scientist here in a mid-sized company in Bay Area tech. After working in this industry for few years, the fact that Data Scientist in no longer a true Data Scientist position is the only natural conclusion I can come up with. There might be few here and there in reputable companies who get to do and productionize complex modeling solutions (especially if you have a PhD), but the overall trend is that most ""Data Scientists"" without PhDs have become SQL monkeys who don't even get to do something as simple as A/B testing. This is like if front-end web developers were rebranded as software engineers.

I mean it's even public knowledge too:  Lyft publicly stated how they rebranded the titles from analyst to scientist and data scientist to research scientist. This was  just to compete with other tech companies for talent that want the ""scientist"" in their title. [https://medium.com/@chamandy/whats-in-a-name-ce42f419d16c](https://medium.com/@chamandy/whats-in-a-name-ce42f419d16c).

How did this happen and what's the consequence? I don't know the precise origin, but I know that today what's driving this movement is the huge rush new grads with ""data science"" degrees, or perhaps waves of career changers from bootcamps who also want to find their gold.  

What's the consequence? I think the consequence is that we all suffer from the rebranding, especially in terms of career development. Those who have been doing true Data Science work (not just SQL all day for metrics tracking) will have to shift expectations and titles in order to preserve what they already have. Being stuck on menial tasks that don't impact business bottom line will make the job susceptible to layoffs far more than those that are in the front lines of business/product impact. It also means lack of promotion and career development, since those who do get those have proven impact on business. 

Yes, I have become jaded and pessimistic about the Data Science world in the Bay, especially not having a PhD myself that limits me from pursuing Research Scientists positions...",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fpcltw/data_scientists_are_just_glorified_analysts_and/,180,1,1585233619

82,Mahalanobis Distance out of two other Mahalanobis Distances,"I'm not sure if this is the appropriate sub for this, but it seemed like the best one since Mahalanobis distance seems to be used for Machine Learning as well. This is for a work in Management though, so not Data Science per se, more Data Science adjacent I suppose.

After getting my head around the Mahalanobis distance, I found statistical significance in the variables I am using calculated with it. There is a pretty established author that measures the same thing I am trying to, and they publish their Mahalanobis Distances, but not their component variables, being that they use different variables to measure this construct. Their variables, and process of recovery is so obscure that it is unlikely that I'd be able to access them myself.

So, to get to the point as quickly as possible, I've was wondering if it is even worth it to look into if it is theoretically sound to aggregate two Mahalanobis Distances with the Mahalanobis Distance, for the same subjects. 

Or would it be better for me to use those my variables and include that distance as another variable. In the same vein, should some ponderation be made regarding how many variables each Mahalanobis distance computes?

I'm still looking at understanding better how Mahalanobis works, but if you guys could offer some input that would be great!",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fpctf3/mahalanobis_distance_out_of_two_other_mahalanobis/,2,1,1585234424

88,[Request] Advice on learning Python . So many options make it confusing,"My objective is to learn Python and use it for machine learning and data science as an important but secondary tool in my career. I'm proficient in R and Stata but almost no previous knowledge in Python. I've checked in [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/python) and [edX](https://www.edx.org/course?search_query=python) but both of them have thematic courses (e.g. Analyzing, Visualizing data with Python) rather than teaching the language comprehensively which I don't love because it limits my options for the future. My question for you guys is if you know of a program that would help me to learn Python from basics to an intermediate level, that are free or for a very small payment.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fph3vn/request_advice_on_learning_python_so_many_options/,6,2,1585249780
