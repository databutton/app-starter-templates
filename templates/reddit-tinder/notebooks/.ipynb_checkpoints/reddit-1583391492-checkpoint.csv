2,Partially Available Features,"Hi folks,

working on an Australian football model at the moment. Have scraped match and player data back to 1897, however, some of the player data doesn't become available until recently. For example, fantasy football points only began in 2011. 

I'm relatively new to machine learning, so I'm unsure if there's a way to handle these features appropriately when they're not available for all examples. My current prototype sets (for example) the difference in average fantasy points between competing teams to zero up until 2011, but I worry this will train the model to view fantasy points as insignificant (which they aren't - strong correlation for the winning team). 

Does anyone have any advice? Is my current approach the only way?",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fdswen/partially_available_features/,4,1,1583401039

8,Deploying Python Environments...looking for community feedback,"Hi all,

I'm working on a project to make cloud deployment easier for data scientists and I'd appreciate some feedback on the direction. My motivation is to make testing and productionisation of work easier.

In summary, the solution is a command line tool which takes a jupyter notebook + requirements.txt/pipfile/environment.yml and does 3 things:

1. Creates a docker image, making a reproducible runtime environment (using [repo2docker](https://github.com/jupyter/repo2docker))
2. Runs the image on google cloud build (using [papermill](https://github.com/nteract/papermill))
3. Creates an API for serving the outputs created with a versioned URL scheme

The idea is we can use it to setup continuous integration in scenarios where working with docker directly was excessively arduous, and I'd like to know if this resonates with anyone?

Likewise I'd like to know how best a tool like this could be consumed by others? It seems like nowadays  running on Kubernetes is necessary to use something inside your company without going through approval processes to use externally hosted tools.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fduenn/deploying_python_environmentslooking_for/,4,1,1583410634

12,"What are some of the overlooked skills/habits that aren't ""sexy,"" but are actually really important? I'm referring to the type of thing you wouldn't brag about on your resume but will actually make a huge difference in your day-to-day workflow and the quality of your work.","An example from programming: writing good documentation, so you can pick up where you left off the next time you open the project, instead of having to reread everything just to get acquainted with your variable names again.

An example from math: actually showing all of your work and not skipping steps because they seem too easy, which is generally where the mistakes start snowballing).

An example from general professional life: being able to write a clear email, which 90% of everyone's coworkers can't seem to do.

For reference: I'm currently a high school math/stat/cs teacher, and I've already been working on my own projects for about a year to develop the ""sexy"" skills that you'll find when you google ""data science skills"" or read a book like ""Data Science From Scratch."" Through my own projects, I've found that books and tutorials gloss over or straight up leave out the majority of day-to-day workflow, like opening your data set in excel just to look at it before writing any code, or writing a script to remove the numbered footnote tags^[3] from text you've scraped off of Wikipedia^[citation needed].

I know this may be a generic question post, but I can't seem to find any recommendations through the search bar for what I'm looking for particularly.

I'm capable of taking the school in English (C2), French (C1) or I suppose Romanian (I really doubt we have anything jaw dropping though, my research came up with nothing).

Particularly, does anyone know any good schools in France and/or Belgium? Has anyone taken the EDHEC Data Analytics MSc?

17,Should KMeans and PCA provide the same clustersd?,"I'm still learning this field, but I had in the past taken my dataset of genomic variants, filter it down by variance, run a PCA plot to see if there were obvious clusters. If I saw two clusters, I would run KMeans with K=2 on the dataset (not the PCA components) and check the PCA again to see if KMeans labeled the same points. Today I did this with a new dataset and it showed 3 very obvious clusters, but when I ran KMeans with K=3, it did not identify the clusters.  I was trying to use KMeans as a quick way to label the groups and verify the clustering so I could look at their associated traits etc.

  

I understand one is a dimensionality reduction tool and the other is an unsupervised learning algorithm, but past that maybe I actually don't know what I am doing.

I've heard that the Mask-RCNN instance segmentation method might not be good for biological images, so should i go with U-net semantic segmentation instead?.

37,Effective Data Wrangling,"Hey. I'm a data engineer for some years already, but I have a big question - how do people perform data prep? From what I can see most of data scientists spend around 90% preparing data (known fact) and minus meetings and this, only a small portion of their time to do what they actually like. 

My encounters ends up with seeing people using R Studio, Python to manually clean and wrangle data with scripting, helper libraries, or their own set of functions, shared amongst the company or even private. Lots of this work is very repetitive and simple.  Am I right here?

There are companies who are tacking this problem, probably most well known and awesome one is [Trifacta](https://www.trifacta.com/) but there are plenty others. Considering Trifacta went commercial from an older open product, and is now also offered by Google Cloud as a built-in service, this somehow tells me the problem is real? There are other frameworks and cloud solutions to tackle some of this problem (i.e. Azure Data Factory, AWS Glue) but I just never see it as a complete solution. Process of preparing ETL pipelines just doesn't feel natural and requires a lot of investment. It's great in terms of productionising ETLs though.

So much questions is whether this problem is real, or am I just dreaming? How do you personally solve data prep effectively?

39,Analysis is going to bring in millions of pounds to business - Can I ask for additional compensation?,"Hi all,

* The context:
   * My analysis has found thousands of business opportunities which are co-funded by the government. In short, this means that the company which I am working for (start-up, capital of £mln) is very likely to receive upwards of £12mln in funding. This is only possible because of the datasets and scripts I have developed over the past 18 months. My work allows the company to screen entire UK for projects which are eligible for government co-funding. Without it, the targeting system would be limited to ""Oh, we've heard..."" and ""Somebody told us about..."".
* The question:
   * What can I get out of it? It's brilliant that the business is going to make a bank using my work but it doesn't mean anything for me. Unless I ask for some.

I’m a third year Industrial and Management Engineering student at RPI in Upstate NY, and was interested in potentially going into the data science/consulting industry. IE is a major that can put you in a wide variety of fields, but I was wondering how “viable” it is for an IE to go into data science?

Would you say Applied Math would be a good start to a data science career?

60,I woefully underestimated the amount of SQL I need to write. Looking for intermediate-advanced tutorials.,"Pretty much the title. I know some SQL, but I'm not very solid at it. I wrote my first self join with a CASE WHEN in the join condition today and felt pretty proud, but looking at some of my teammates, it's pretty obvious my SQL skill could use some improvement. As much as I love pandas, if I can do a fair amount of data-prep up front, I'd prefer that (and it keeps our DBAs employed).

One of my teammates took a SQL query that another department wrote and sped it up by an order of magnitude (45 minutes to about 4 minutes) by pulling data into four different temporary tables and joining on those. That's the sort of insight I'm looking to build.

Any recommendations on tutorials? I'm looking for some intermediate SQL resources, preferably geared toward teaching you *when* you'd want to use certain techniques.

66,Activation Functions in Deep Learning,"In simplest terms, I will add a few points, just to build your interest to give it a read.

&amp;#x200B;

✔ Without an activation function, a simple #neuralnetwork is just a linear regression model. 

&amp;#x200B;

✔ We need activation functions to add complexity and non-linearity in our model equation, so that it can understand, all the complex relationships in data, create all functional mappings of inputs to outputs.

&amp;#x200B;

✔ So, we use these mathematical functions, which we know like #linear, #sigmoid, #tanh etc and are easily differentiable to perform #backpropogation #optimization strategy while propogating backwards in the network to compute gradients of Error (loss) with respect to Weights and then accordingly optimize weights using #GradientDescent.

&amp;#x200B;

That's it. so, our output comes interacting with activation function.

&amp;#x200B;

Remember!

☛ Regression, use tanh , relu (use in hidden layers) and linear in output layer to get back NN outputs to continous values. 

☛ Classification ,use sigmoid/softmax in output layer.

tanh cause #VanishingGradient, it will never converge then and keep training, so use wisely.

If dead neurons, use #leakyRelu, #Maxout.

Happy Weekend

78,Is a STAR-format based resume the right approach in describing data science experience?,"I am personally a fan of the [STAR format](https://www.zipjob.com/blog/star-method-resume/) for interviews or for my resume. 

For example, instead of saying something like: 

&gt;I built an anomaly detection model using isolation forests to identify click fraud, thus saving $100M a year

I would frame it using the STAR approach:

&gt;Click-Fraud Detection: Online ad platforms earn revenue when users click on an affiliated ad placed in a website, sharing part of the revenue with the website owner. Fraudulent users try to subvert this model, by building automated programs that mimic a genuine click from a genuine user.  
&gt;  
&gt;I worked with a major Australian ad platform in developing a click-fraud detection model. I used an Isolation Forest model, leveraging features like click-velocity of user, time-of-day, User's IP etc, in order to identify a fraudulent user before they have caused too much damage.  
&gt;  
&gt;The model achieved a positive predictive value of 70%, resulting in savings of $100M a year.

My questions:

1. Is this too verbose a format? Some of my reasons for this format:
   1. It's easy to wrongly assume people are familiar with the problem or even the industry. In the above example, exposition about what click-fraud is seems unnecessary. That is a toy example chosen for ease of understanding. Some industries, like Finance or Healthcare, have some very dense jargon which will never make sense to someone not intimately familiar with the industry.
   2. An ML project involves a lot of steps. This lets me flesh out a very high level summary of what happened. For instance, reading what I have written, it's easy to understand what the data sort-of looked like due to the examples of the features.
2. How do I manage content overload?
   1. Due to a large number of projects, the 2 pages now look extremely wordy.
   2. I have little hope that a recruiter would take the 5 minutes necessary to read and understand my experience. Due to the verbose format, ""ML jargon-density"" is very low. My fear is that the recruiter would eye-ball the 2 pages, see very few ""keywords"" like ""Random Forest"" or ""LSTM"" and would reject the resume.

In summary, I now face a weird choice. 

If I go ahead with the STAR format, I have a resume which is easy-to-understand (at least if it's done right), but the word count is high and there's a good chance an overworked recruiter will skim and decide against going forward. 

If I go with a more one-liner approach, the keyword-density definitely increases. This means that the skimming recruiter will catch a lot of ML-specific jargon. However, it's unlikely they would really understand what the problem was and what my solution did.
