3,I made a web-app that scrapes data from reddit.,"I've been learning about LSTM models for NLP. I've decided to train some models on subreddit post titles to generate text akin to a subreddit.

I created a tool to easily scrape subreddits posts, [I turned it in to a web-app](http://scrapereddit.pythonanywhere.com/) so anybody can use it. (This was a good opportunity for me to learn how to use Flask). I thought I'd share it here in case anybody else would like to scrape reddit. Also the site can generate word clouds from any subreddit. (Just added this for fun).

&amp;#x200B;

If anybody actually ends up using this I will expand functionality to scrape comments, images, add different post-proccessing methods, etc. I'm even thinking about moving some models to the browser so people could generate posts/comments on their own.

&amp;#x200B;

If you have any ideas on how this web-app could be improved please let me know!

&amp;#x200B;

You can check the app out here: [http://scrapereddit.pythonanywhere.com/](http://scrapereddit.pythonanywhere.com/)

6,What is your data science workflow?,"I've been trying to get into data science and I'm interested in how you organize your workflow. I don't mean libraries and stuff like that but the development tools and how you use them.

Currently I use a Jupyter notebook in PyCharm in a REPL-like fashion and as a software engineer I am very underwhelmed with the development experience. There has to be a better way. In the notebook, I first import all my CSV-data into a pandas dataframe and then put each ""step"" of the data preparation process into its own cell. This quickly gets very annoying when you have to insert print statements everywhere, selectively rerun or skip earlier cells to try out something new and so on. In PyCharm there is no REPL in the same context as the notebook, no preview pane for plots from the REPL, no usable dataframe inspector like you have in RStudio. It's a very painful experience. 

Another problem is the disconnect between experimenting and putting the code into production. One option would be to sample a subset of the data (since pandas is so god damn slow) for the notebook, develop the data preparation code there and then only paste the relevant parts into another python file that can be used in production. You can then either throw away the notebook or keep it in version control. In the former case, you lose all the debugging code: If you ever want to make changes to the production code, you have to write all your sampling, printing and plotting code from the lost notebook again (since you can only reasonably test and experiment in the notebook). In the latter case, you have immense code duplication and will have trouble keeping the notebook and production code in-sync. There may also be issues with merging the notebooks if multiple people work on it at once. 

After the data preparation is done, you're going to want to test out different models to solve your business problem. Do you keep those experiments in different branches forever or do you merge everything back into master, even models that weren't very successful? In case you merge them, intermediate data might accumulate and make checking out revisions very slow.

9,Does a MSDS offer a competitive advantage over a MSCS for data scientist roles?,"I’m comparing and contrasting these curriculums and it seems like MSDS programs (not surprisingly) have more courses directly dedicated to data science specific toolset like CRMs, Hardoop, Spark etc.

One would think that should be enough to say it has an advantage but I wonder if the program is too applied.

For example a MSDS has no courses in data structures and algorithms, and only graze aspects of software development. Many of the stats courses don’t really teach any thing higher than stats many have already learned in a year long stats and prob sequence, just in the context of big data.

So I wonder if a MSCS that focuses on machine learning would actually be even more competitive. Specific tools like Hardoop and Spark can be learned on eDx.org or during an internship. 

But maybe software development skills, algorithms, and data structures really aren’t that valuable for data scientists. Thoughts?",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/bi5jvf/does_a_msds_offer_a_competitive_advantage_over_a/,48,73,1556411256

30,"For medicine project, looking for data scientist/machine learning engineer, and I hope to hear how you guys think of big data and AI driven medical challenge project.","**- Introduce:**

Hi. I'm working as deep learning engineer.

I'm interested in starting a startup company which deals with big data driven medicine project.

Strong computing power and big data are new paradigm resources that we can use in this era.

So, I think methodology using them probably can be paradigm shift and game changer.

For example, there are research papers that say eating 3 eggs in a week is good for the health, and there are research papers that say eating 3 eggs in a week is harm for the health. There can be various reasons that this paradoxical situation happens.

As all other people think, I also just think using strong computing power and big data can help that paradoxical situation.

&amp;#x200B;

**- What I would like to do:**

I'm interested in genomics, cancer, better treatment/diagnosis, new drug discovery, etc.

And I'm also interested in better A.I. like AGI (artificial general intelligence) which is enhanced in its systemic architecture by mimicking neuroscience mechanism as a long-term goal which is valuable goal itself worth to pursue as well as the supporting technique that can help short-term medicine challenge goals.

&amp;#x200B;

\- **What I'm looking for:**

For the first, I'm looking for data scientist, machine learning engineer who can start open data science competitions like from Kaggle.

And if we can make good working, I would like to launch a startup together.

&amp;#x200B;

**- PS:**

As working is going, I'll tell you my thoughts on what I would like to do, what I have as problem recognition on current medicine field.

31,Where to find data?,"I wonder if anyone could share with me some general strategies to finding data sources for training. I'm a developer working with web /mobile applications. There are some niches I see where applying ML would be great for users, but often they are (1) sparse in data for an open-source project to train on; and (2) have some niche player, often a SaaS, that has years of customer data making them the only effective solution.

I just read an article on applying ML to optimizing landing pages for advertising campaigns, and the thought I'd like to confirm is that a company with years of data from running a page-builder has an insurmountable lead that a non-proprietary alternative would never be able to catch up to (for lack of training data). That's an example, I've run into the though often enough to ask if there are possibilities I don't see for finding data (and where to ask it - if this is the right place).",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/biil8a/where_to_find_data/,10,3,1556500905

Then interviews that quiz your understanding of the storage of algorithms- eg how does a hash map store data, is it more efficient than an array list or queue

I wrote [an article about OpenAI's GPT-2 language model](https://blog.floydhub.com/gpt2/), which recently got published on [the FloydHub blog](https://blog.floydhub.com/). In it, I explain most of the NLP breakthroughs that led to the creation of what media outlets are referring to as ""the AI that's too dangerous to release."" You can read the article [here](https://blog.floydhub.com/gpt2/).

&amp;#x200B;

Like in my [previous article](https://blog.nanonets.com/hyperparameter-optimization/), I included a jupyter notebook that can be run with just a few clicks, so that you see an actual, live, demo running in real time. The demo includes a pretrained GPT-2 ([courtesy of hugging face](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-pretrained-BERT)) that can generate text based on a prompt that you provide.

&amp;#x200B;

I've stayed away from any opinions on the decision not to release the full model since I feel that there's been plenty of that on twitter already. Here, I aim to provide a clear and straightforward explanation of how exactly the algorithm works, so that you can make your own informed decisions.

With digital, a lot of attribution is based on clicks rather than inference. Nevertheless, there are things like offline advertising such as TV or radio, as well as users who see an add online but might visit the website and transact directly, thereby skipping the click based attrbution.

&amp;#x200B;

Suppose I have a dataset with marketing spend across various channels, including both digital and offline channels e.g. Youtube, Facebook, Radio, TV, Paid Search. If the dataset has, for each day, the spend on each channel along with the number of site visits and transactions, which model or approach would you use to explain transactions as a function of the other channels?

For me a simple multiple regression came to mind but I wondered if there are approaches beyond this? Or any gotchas that others have encountered? Or just any tips for a project like this?

I am based in Europe (it would be useful if posters could clarify what experience they have of what country/region).

&amp;#x200B;

**Does anyone have any experience in pricing models for motor insurance?**

**Is it me, or does the pricing seem very unstable, not robust and almost random?**

Does anyone have similar experiences?

&amp;#x200B;

Is it the fault of poorly constructed black-box models? Or is it something else?

I say that because the pricing seems very unstable and not robust, in the sense that:

* it varies a lot within the same month, even without changing any of the inputs, and
* it is affected a lot by small changes in some of the inputs, including inputs for which it is not clear at all whether they should have any impact at all, or why

Some examples:

* I have seen prices vary by up to 20% within a month. I mean the same insurer, with absolutely the same parameters, could price a policy at 400 one day, at 320 next week, then at more than 400 the next. 
* Pricing seems affected by totally bonkers parameters. How can the same insurer charge 1/3 more to insurer a 2014 car vs a 2015 car (all else being the same)? If anything, you’d expect the 2014 car to be worth slightly less, not more. Maybe an older car is less reliable, but 1/3 more for a one-year difference?
* Some insurers have admitted using email address as an input to their pricing. 

I suppose **the more general question is around the merits or perils of using black-box models**, for which we do not really understand the impact of each input: the model spits out a result, but you can’t really tell what is driving what. Call me old-fashioned, but assigning a big importance to some input just because a model says so, without really understanding why, seems ludicrous to me. The risk of overfitting is huge.

&amp;#x200B;

What are your thoughts and experiences?

&amp;#x200B;

PS a separate discussion is to what extent the models price the risk, and to what extent they price customers’ inertia, e.g. maybe a customer who has been with the same company is less likely to shop around, so let’s charge him 20% more than what we charge a new customer with the same profile? Or maybe residents of a certain neighbourhood are wealthier and won’t spend too much time to save a little on their insurance, so let’s charge them more?

I say this because it’s common for insurers to reduce their premium, especially at renewal, if you haggle a little – but none of this would explain the points I made earlier.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/bj5xfw/pricing_models_for_motor_insurance_who_has/,16,0,1556644684

- IP address
- Session ID
- Username
- What user typed in the bot or what button they clicked
- The bot's response
- The confidence score generated by our AI platform
- Where they accessed the bot from 
- Main intent triggered by the user

So far I've been looking line-by-line at the spreadsheet looking at how well each interaction went. I've created 3 failure categories that I flag in the spreadsheet.
- Unsupported intent: user asks for something the bot doesn't support yet
- Intent confusion: bot was confused by what user entered
- Unsatisfactory response: the content returned was technically the correct response but the user wasn't satisfied.

1. ARMAX/ARIMAX, which incorporates covariates into the model as additional terms
2. Regression with ARIMA errors, which is regression first, and ARIMA in the regression model's error term

One part under the 'Regression with ARMA errors' section stuck with me but I can't seem to figure it out:

"" **There is not much to choose between the models in terms of forecasting ability**, but the additional ease of interpretation in the second one makes it attractive. ""

Does this mean that the two approaches have similar forecasting abilities? How was this conclusion determined? 

A big advantage for the second approach to me is that it is readily available in R under the Forecast package-- I can't yet seem to find a way to easily perform the first approach in R-- much appreciate your advice!",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/bjjrpc/time_series_question_arimax_vs_regression_with/,0,2,1556731108

97,"Has anyone used 'Mode' before? (data science platform for python, R, &amp; SQL)","I got an ad today for a software service called Mode. It seems to be an online platform that runs python, R, and SQL (interchangeably?) and the notebooks can easily be collaborated upon across a team. 

I'm curious about the following:

A) Does it allow for distributed computing? (i.e. 'big data')

B) Can you run python, R, and SQL all in the same notebook? This wouldn't be too surprising as you can run python in R using the reticulate package (allegedly you can transfer py-to-R objects back and forth, tho I haven't been successful yet; but that's a separate convo) and likewise, you can SQL in both python &amp; R via several packages/libraries.

C) How does it fair on massive datasets? A bit of a continuation on q(A) above. 

D) Did using Mode increase your team's productivity/fluidity of projects or did it just feel like learning another framework?",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/bjko7e/has_anyone_used_mode_before_data_science_platform/,2,1,1556735464
98,Getting started with Data Science,"Hello, i'm a university student (or college if you're american) majoring in Management IT, i'm currently through my final year doing my final year project for a bachelor's. Through my internship the term  data science has been recurring for quite some time, i watched some introductory videos and read some articles about data science, i got an idea about what it is (roughly) and i decided i'd want to get into it, i love dealing with data sheets, databases and algorithms, partially because i've always considered myself to be a backend developer since i'm not that creative with front end design and i liked making algorithms and dealing with data from databases, so what would be the best way to getting started with data science? there are a few courses in coursera done by IBM and reputable american universities, there's also a free course on edx by Microsoft, what do you advise me to do.
