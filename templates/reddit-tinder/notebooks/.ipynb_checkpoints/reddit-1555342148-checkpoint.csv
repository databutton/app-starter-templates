2,Caliper. Measure what matters for hiring in AI. At scale.,"Hello [r/datascience](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience),

I am the co-founder of Caliper ([caliper.ai](https://caliper.ai)). Caliper enables recruiters to evaluate practical AI skills through automated bite-sized challenges on real-world problems.

With the growing number of ML engineer positions in companies as well as relevant candidates, it seems useful to be able to evaluate a candidate's practical ML skills in a scalable way, in a screening stage, even before they come for an on-site interview.

This exists for testing CS algorithms and data structures in the usual coding interviews, but performance on those isn't necessarily correlated with practical ML skills.

It would be nice if recruiters or hiring managers could create a challenge around some data, invite candidates to participate in the challenge, see how they do, look at their code if they'd like, and then decide if they'd like to interview (and eventually hire!) the candidates.

Here's a post on the what, why, and how of Caliper's mission, and its guiding principles. [https://medium.com/caliper/introducing-caliper-3109fbd84513](https://medium.com/caliper/introducing-caliper-3109fbd84513)

And here is a post that introduces automatic challenge templates, practice arenas, and Colab integration on Caliper. [https://medium.com/caliper/caliper-challenges-8ebff4896d73](https://medium.com/caliper/caliper-challenges-8ebff4896d73)

&amp;#x200B;

Is it a good approach to make a ""clean"" database with only the fields we need, renamed to make more sense and with the data cleaned. And then run analyses and algorithms on that clean database. I think this would speed up the data processing for each query, and it would be a good way to clarify the assumptions we are making. This is a team effort, so it might also be easier for the other members of the team to understand what is going on with the clean database.

50,Sharing dashboards with clients. PowerBI vs Tableau.,"I have a full time job in analytics, and a personal project on the side. This project involves NLP and insights extraction from massive datasets, and the final user should be able to use PowerBI / Tableau to access the results and consume the product. All the back end and data processing is working fine, but I need to find a way to:

* *show the results to potential customers (I have some custom examples for that)*
* *provide a viz platform to consume the product*

I use PowerBI and Tableau in my full time job, but in a corporate environment where we own licenses and have server versions of everything, and I dont have first hand experience with the different options. 

In terms of power and features, Tableau fits a little better my needs, but with some creativity and extra custom tables I can do it with PowerBI. Also, PowerBI has other plus: people coming from MS Office tend to feel more comfortable, and my potential customers are not analytics professionals. 

Anyways, both are fine. 

The ideal tool / set-up should provide:

1. *a way to build sample dashboards for free / very cheap (****may be Tableau Public? something similar with PowerBI?****)*
2. *a way to share those semi-public dashboards with potential customers*
3. *a way to build and share private dashboards with real clients*

51,"Ride-share company: Data scientist interview question- For forecasting service demand, how can you characterize the stochastic nature of demand?","I recently got this question for an interview and I am debating what would have been the best answer. In the previous question I was asked how I would model the deterministic components of service demand on any given 1-hour time-window (for predicting how many users log in to the app during that hour in a certain area). I said I would use all available feature (date-time, weekday, working day/not, weekend/not, weather, etc) and construct a multiple linear /polynomial regression model to predict the number of users logging in any given hour

&amp;#x200B;

The following is my answer on how I would account for time series stochasticity (something I am less confident in):

 I said the short-term memory effect has to be taken into consideration, and one way would to do so would be to incorporate an Autoregressive model into the Multiple Regression model. This involves regressing the demand on lagged values, or demand from the previous few hours. By using lag values as features for multiple regression, I said I can likely come up with more accurate predictions. And of course, I mentioned that the number of lag terms to be included can be determined by using the Autocorrelation function (ACF)

However, I feel that if I was working on this project for an airline, I feel that it would've been sufficient to just show a bar chart with each classification along the x-axis and the average fuel rate across all legs for a specific aircraft.

68,How to (Adequately) Prepare for Applying to Data Science Master's Programs?,"Hey all.

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently studying Economics and Political Science. I have taken a mixture of courses from both majors - the most enjoyable  ones, however, were more of the research and quantitative methods/math-ey ones. I had continually thought these courses were merely ""interesting"" and that they weren't serve me much in the career I had originally planned; I wanted to become a lawyer. It wasn't until this semester that I was completely wrong in that aspect. 

For the sake of not making this post too long: I am taking econometrics and survey methods courses this semester, as well as doing some research for a polling institution (with slight work in SPSS). I have realized, that the statistical methodology and software (e.g. R, Python, SAS, SPSS) used to describe and analyze the content from said courses (as well as examining the syllabi for advanced econometrics/statistics courses) are not only incredibly fascinating, but also is something I would like to do for a living. Every time I am tasked with anything related to data cleaning, gathering, and modeling, I'd always ask myself, ""How can I effectively clean this data? Which regression model would work best to describe the relationship? Is my analysis far off from what could be the truth?"".  Now, I'm aware that econometrics isn't all what data science is about, but every time I read up stuff about data mining, machine learning, natural language processing, predictive analytics, etc., I get really engaged and curious. Such was the decision that made me want to pursue a career in data science instead of law.

The main problem that I see myself confronting, however, is: Do I have a chance to get accepted in a master's program in data science? I've done a lot of research into DS master's programs - mostly those in NY. Just about most of them require that prospective students have at least: Calc III, Linear Algebra, and introductory computer science coursework (and, for some, courses in probability and statistics). Needless to say, it's too late to apply to them now. But, I'll apply next semester, and can expect that I will have all of these prerequisites done by graduation (next year; requires that I drop my Political Science major to a minor one). But, I'm insecure and nervous about the application process. I don't come from a ""hard-core"" relevant STEM (e.g. math, stats, or comp sci)  background - only a social science one. The most I can do is have all the prerequisites done and hope for the best (**I could, however, drop my two probability and statistics courses for a quantitative poli/sci thesis, but I'm not sure how much that's valued**). But, even then, there's still the unknown probability that I'll get rejected from all the schools (especially my top choice school) that I'll apply to next semester, which would be really upsetting.

&amp;#x200B;

So, my questions for this would be: Do you think it is still possible for me to be at least competitive for DS master's programs, despite my background? What else, do you suggest, I should do before I apply to these DS schools? How much is an undergraduate thesis valued in the eyes of DS master's admission committees/officers?  And what other advice or tips would you give me as an aspiring data scientist, who doesn't come from the traditional CS background?",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/befe21/how_to_adequately_prepare_for_applying_to_data/,4,1,1555548631

​However, my next project is literally all development work. My manager told me that he wants me focusing on the development side for this project. This project is projected to take about 8 months to complete -- not counting support/debugging for QA, meaning I will be working a year as a full blown developer. This is not what I was hired to do, and I do not enjoy it.

​I've tried to force myself into a DS AND dev role by trying to get onto side projects, but my manager keeps jumping in and says ""this is a really great idea and approach, I'm going to give it to person X to do so you can focus on the dev work."" This has happened multiple times already in just the past month.

​What is the best way to go about getting out of this hole that they're trying to force me into? I don't mind the occasional development work, but I was hired as a data scientist, not a developer.

I have been tasked with creating some basic forecasts for our business instead of our current budgeted numbers that don't have much statistical support. The problem is that our business has recently gone a huge expansion where we expect revenue numbers of about 30% or higher and we only have about 3 weeks of data since this expansion. Our data is highly seasonal as well. These forecasts are not business-critical so a high-level of accuracy is preferred, but not required. I was thinking something along the lines of using exponential smoothing with a ""new expansion"" factor but I'm sure there are better ways of doing it. I would like to keep the seasonal trends in tact but use the last 3 weeks of increased revenue as a baseline.

91,"If you’re an data scientist/engineer, don’t become a Product manager/program manager/engineering/etc manager so early on in your career.","I don’t mean to say management is a bad career path. It pays well if you are good but you really have to understand the dynamics of your company and the people you work with. That real talent comes with more than just a few years of experience. 

Here are some other reasons

It’s easier to transition from engineering or data science to management than vice versa. Once your branded product manager, it’s harder to shake off that brand if you want to go back to being a techie. 

It’s also harder to get a new job in management at a different company than it is to get another job in engineering. This is because of the way fewer openings for management in comparison to data science/engineering. 

Job security is a big reason too. Junior product managers are more likely to be laid off when the bottom line goes south than say a junior engineer. Lots of companies have this notion that product managers at the lower levels can be easily replaced but the same can’t be said for techies. 

However...

if your calling really is one of those management roles, my tip is do this after you level up in the engineering/data science realm. That is don’t jump ship as a junior data engineer of data scientist to product manager. Do this after you become say a senior data scientist/data engineer. 

Why? You’ll have much more respect as a manager if you could say you were a senior data scientist or senior engineer prior to the role. The engineering/data team will respect your tech credentials more and will be more likely to listen to your feature enhancements or timelines for completion as you know the product that well. Management will also be more likely to view you as a subject matter expert and will more likely to trust your nuggets of wisdom.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/benefp/if_youre_an_data_scientistengineer_dont_become_a/,6,14,1555603944
