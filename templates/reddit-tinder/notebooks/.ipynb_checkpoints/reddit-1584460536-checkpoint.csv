3,White House &amp; Partners Launch COVID-19 AI Open Research Dataset Challenge on Kaggle,"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the White House on Monday joined a number of research groups to announce the release of the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) of scholarly literature about COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and the Coronavirus group. The release came with an urgent call to action to the world’s AI experts to “develop new text and data mining techniques that can help the science community answer high-priority scientific questions related to COVID-19.”

5,Validating models for individual behavior using aggregate results,"Hi - is there a name for the process of building/validating a model of individual behavior when you only have aggregate data available for the response variable (but do have individual-level data for the predictor variables)? I've tried googling various things and can't get anything to pop up. I'm hoping to find a book or two on the subject.

My particular use-case is: I have lots of variables for voters - age, sex, zip code, etc., I would like to predict if they will vote Democrat or Republican but I only have precinct-level results (precincts vary in size from 2 registered voters to 2,880, but most are around 1,000; I have 8900 precincts). In my mind, a good model would cause my predictions for individuals to create similar results to the actual precinct results when aggregated.

A second, related question - what is generally considered best practice when using census or similar aggregated data as a predictor variable - for instance, if I have the median income for a census block is it ok to simply assign this to an individual living in that census block? This seems a little simplistic, so I was wondering if there are any good resources, particularly books on the subject.

35,Working from raw source data from a filepath containing spaces using make and Makefiles,"I have a repository that uses python scripts and a Makefile. I want to have a setup procedure that
allows them to easily set up an environment and copy in the necessary data files from our server.

The problem with including the source data files in the Makefile is that the company server uses 
spaces in the drive name, which make doesn't like very much, so I can list those files as dependencies
for the target output file.

My current Makefile basically does only the following:

```
.PHONY : all
all : output.csv

.PHONY : copy_data_to_local_folder
copy_data_to_local_folder :
	python copyfile.py ""V:\\Server Path\\With Spaces\\Inputs 1.csv"" local/inputs1.csv
	python copyfile.py ""V:\\Server Path\\With Spaces\\Inputs 2.csv"" local/inputs2.csv

output.csv : combine_data.R local/inputs1.csv local/inputs2.csv
	Rscript $^ $@
```

The `copy_data_to_local_folder` part is just to get the data to the local directory, but it isn't included 
in the DAG leading to the production of `output.csv` (i.e. `all : output.csv copy_data_to_local_folder`) or else
the target would need to run everytime.

My solution ideas are the following, but I'm not sure what's best practice:

1. **Use a different make tool.** I could use `Luigi` in Python or `Drake` in R, but I would prefer to keep 
the tool somewhat more generalized.

2. **Run a setup script to copy in files.** I assume there would be a way to run the file copying scripts
as part of the environment setup, but I am unfamiliar with how to do this.

I am not sure about the best way to do this. I want to be able to share the code with a co-worker and have them
be able to get up and running on their system without too much messing around to configure. Is there a best
practice for this situation?",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fksdx3/working_from_raw_source_data_from_a_filepath/,0,1,1584549161

As you can see, the course does not match with current data science trend. It is too general. 

On the other hand, the master course of Statistics require following classes to be taken:Principles of Statistical Inference, Multivariate Statistical Analysis, Linear Models and Regression Analysis, Statistical Computing, Categorical Data Analysis, Data Visualization and Graphical Tests and etc.

I go over joins and some use cases on how to use them. I would love for you to check it out and give me any feedback on it. 

I have almost all of them recorded already and will be uploading them each week. The topics include Joins, Unions, Case Statements, Updating/Deleting Data, Partition By, Data Types, Aliasing, Views, Having Clause, GetDate(), and Primary vs Foreign Key. 

After that I will be doing an Advanced Series as well.

I hope this is helpful! Please let me know what you think!

68,Similar to Median Absolute Deviation,"Hello all!

What do you call the algorithm that is similar to median absolute deviation, but instead of taking using the median as the location estimate of the data. You measure how far away the observations are from the typical distance between observations. In other words, the median of absolute distance between x\_i and x\_i+1?

Does anyone use this? I found this paper describes how robust this method I'm describing is [https://web.archive.org/web/20101214105931/http://web.ipac.caltech.edu/staff/fmasci/home/statistics\_refs/BetterThanMAD.pdf](https://web.archive.org/web/20101214105931/http://web.ipac.caltech.edu/staff/fmasci/home/statistics_refs/BetterThanMAD.pdf) . However, the paper doesn't seem to give it an easily identifiable name. I'm wondering what it's called and whether anyone has used to identify anomalous series.

71,User-Level Prediction Based on Post History,"Im working on a deep learning project that aims to make a categorical prediction on a user-level based on their Reddit post history. So for example, if the label categories are {not_depressed, mild_depression, depressed, suicidal}, the chosen label has been assigned to a user based on the totality of their posts.

Each row of my dataset is an individual post. Some users have up to 500 posts, some have as low as 10. If I concatenate the posts together based on user, the assigned label is accurate but the text sequence length is far too big (average 14k words after cleaning and removing a lot of words). If I don't concatenate but learn based on individual posts, the text sequences are an appropriate size (avg 30 words) but then the model thinks the label is assigned on a post level.

Any tips?",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fle23m/userlevel_prediction_based_on_post_history/,5,1,1584639329

92,Need advice regarding on going tussle in Data Science department at office.,"Hi,

I am working as Data Scientist for 2 years in a startup in Bangalore, including internship where most of my work had data cleaning and data wrangling profile. It has been 1.5 years working as one. Now, the current scenario due to funding and new clients has shifted towards more challenging projects. One of them is Super Resolution and OCR (Japanese, has very little literature to go through ) and Super Resolution for text images for English and Japanese (again , a challenging and subjective as per buisness problem). The thing is the management thinks that if a paper is published for super resolution it will work on our data too, plus the Data science manager is sort of ""yes sir"" guy and makes us work on simply hit and trial, as of two years one thing I am sure that Data Science is not just simply trying anything till we reach accuracy without going through in details. The learning curve has just gone down to trying tessarct, kraken etc and same goes for Super resolution, just feed the data and see it works or not. I want to tell the management that it is not worth and we need a better resource on ML and DL who can actually break it down and guide us in a more logical and systematic direction instead of just trying different paper with a dataset which is exactly opposite to ours and trying random things (frameworks, just any random paper published). Now, if I say it directly, it won't go down well with my Data Science manager and if I don't I will have to suffer doing it again and again or eventually fired because I am sure we are not progressing in any direction.
